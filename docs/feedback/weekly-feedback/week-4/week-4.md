# Meeting

#### Meeting Organization


Chair: Aiste

Minute taker: Leonardo

Mark: **Pass**

Feedback:
- The meeting had a chair + minute taker and had a good organization overall.


#### Agenda 

Mark: **Very Good**

Feedback: 
- The agenda is commited in time and was organized very nice and on point.
- As a **TOP** I also liked the sub-points organization. I also liked that you incorporated the *Demo* and the task distribution parts. 
- As a **TIP** since our agendas are usually very ahead of time, don't feel pressured to use the whole timeslot. You can add smaller time intervals of time that can reflect our short and organized meeting.


#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker

Mark: **Excellent**

Feedback:
- The notes are were submitted on time.
- As a **TOP** I really liked the organization and clairty of notes. They are extensive and very descriptive. I like the difference between points of action and notes per agenda item. Great work.



#### Chair performance

Mark: **Good**

Feedback:
- The performance overall was good, it was organized, and followed the agenda.
- As a **TOP** I liked the pace of the chair and the organization. I also really like the feedback round incouraged by the chair.
- As a **TIP** try to address the people that are not that involved, for example the note taker is usally more quiet. To help with this issue, I recommend after every point make a small summary so the notetaker can be part of the discussion and also have time for the minutes. You could also make a short summary of the meeting in the end, even if our meeting are short and on point.


#### Attitude & Relation

Mark: **Very Good**

Feedback:
- The team took the ownership of the meeting, and organized.
- Everybody was active and cooperant most of the time.
- You are very receptive to feedback and in general listen to each other opinions, good job. Most of to have a nice relation among the group. I also liked that everybody started to be more involved in the discussion. Keep that up.
- As a **Tip** you could extend the feedback part more, meaning that mostly I am the one giving feedback and sometimes some members. It could be good, since we have time, to actually here everybody and see what you did great or can be improved in your perspective.


#### Potentially Shippable Product

Mark: **Good**

Feedback:
- There was a potentially shippable application, with some progress. It was small but good progress. Make sure you keep that up for the future. I want to see more from you guys since we aim for a good grade and I am sure you can step up.
- Please make sure you also incorporate the feedback on code contribution in order to improve the process quality (you will recieve this by this week coresponding to the progress in week 3).
- As a **TOP** I appreciate that you acted fast on the feedback and came with one laptop to show the demo from main. I also liked that you kept me updated with the progress of each member and also the next tasks assigned.
