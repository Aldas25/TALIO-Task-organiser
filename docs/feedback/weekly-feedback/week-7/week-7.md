#### Attitude & Relation

Mark: Good

Feedback:

- The meeting was good, people had professional attitude and listened to each other making the meeting productive. 
- People were a little quiet, should get more involvement.


#### Potentially Shippable Product

Mark: Good

Feedback:

- You presented a demo, with some progress (websockets and more functionality on basics) since last time. You have a lot of work in progress, but based on what is on main, you may pass with the basic features. If you aim for a higher grade, you should step up a little.
