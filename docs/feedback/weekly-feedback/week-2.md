# Week 2

## Formative Assessment

- **Chair**:  Lenk≈°as, Aldas 
- **Notetaker**: Maris, Jan


#### Meeting Organization

Mark: Pass

Feedback: The meeting went good, you had a chair and selected a minute taker. 


#### Agenda 

Mark: Good

Feedback: The agenda was available in time, we decided it will be available 1 day before meeting. Don't forget from now to make it available on gitlab 1 day in advance.
It did follow the template and had strong points.

#### Chair performance

Mark: Sufficient

Feedback: The chair did a great job moderating, making sure all topics are covered. It kept the discussion on point. As a tip, try to make everybody contribute to the discussion by asking for their opinion individually. This is a very impotant task.

#### Time management

Mark: Good
Feedback: There was time for all topics, we even finished earlier. Everything was on point and planned in advance. Maybe try to gather a list of question in advance so I can look at it and make the meeting even smoother.

#### Minute taker performance

Mark: Sufficient

Feedback: The notes were good, I see that most of the important points and agreements are noted. It also followed the template, to keep a good structure. You did not have a laptop and were a not that prepared for your task. Try to be a little more prepared.


#### Relation

Mark: Sufficient

Feedback: Again, not everybody was that involved. There were some very quiet people, which could be involved more by the team. Try to see who is quiet and encourage them.
The meeting was balanced and respectful.
