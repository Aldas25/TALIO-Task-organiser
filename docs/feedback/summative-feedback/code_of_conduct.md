# Code of conduct

- Please make sure you reput the assignment in the right place. 


### General

Mark: Good

Feedback:
- In general, every section has a good structure and clear explainations.
- You could detail more on some parts, which will be reflected in the rubric per part.


### Assignment Description

Mark: Good
Feedback:
- The description is well structured and clear, but you do not detail enough on more than code assignment. You also have to work together in various small assignments(e.g. backlog, coc)

### Products

Mark: Excellent

Feedback:
- You were very clear and structured in presenting the deliverables and their platforms. The standards are also extensive and clear. Great job.

- You have a plan for communication channels for different type of information, but you do not go further in detailing. You could have also mention how you communicate on planning your meetings.

### Division of Tasks and Roles
  
Mark: Sufficient/Good

### Meetings
  
Mark: Good

Feedback:

- You could improve by adding information on how non-TA meetings are happening.

### Decision Making
  
Mark: Good

Feedback:

### Consequences
  
Mark: Sufficient

Feedback: 
- You created a nice general system, but did not go into depth if different problems require different consequences.


### Success Factors
  
Mark: Good

Feedback:
- You decided on a good success factor, that seems a little personal, especially the fun part.

### Norms or Evaluation Criteria
  
Mark: Very Good

Feedback:
- You chose 6 very nice criteria that are detailed and not so basic.
- An improvement could be to detail on why you chose them.
