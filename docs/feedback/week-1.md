#### 1) Self-organization

Sufficient - You tried to moderate the meeting after the intro round and self-organized on the code of conduct, platforms etc, but you sometimes needed more help from me. Don't forget that you should be in charge from now on.
As a tip, you could try to involve everybody more in the meeting. Some people were a little quite.

#### 2) Suggested Topics

Sufficient - You covered the suggested topics, but as I mentioned, you needed my help to keep you on the good direction.
We expect you to come up with the topics suggested from the lecturer, I hope that will be smoother from week 2. 
Try to create structure for meetings by using the agenda, making sure we all follow the topics and the meeting doesn't deviate. (you should be familiar with how to conduct a meeting from the teamwork)
