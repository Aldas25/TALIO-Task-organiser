# Meeting

#### Meeting Organization


Chair: Leonardo Marcuzzi
Minute taker: Aldas Lenk≈°as 

Mark: Pass

Feedback:
- The meeting had a chair + minute taker and had a good organization overall


#### Agenda 

Mark: Good

Feedback: 
- The agenda is commited in time, but it should be commited by the chair of that week, please keep this in mind
- It was very organized and had strong points
- As a tip, I recomment to always analize the past agendas so you learn from experience how to estimate time frames. For example, I feel feedback round is important for you since you want to improve a lot, thus maybe more than 3 minutes could be a better choice next time.


#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker

Feedback:

- I provided feedback for this last time. From now the minute taker will recieve feedback as stated. The next week feedback will include the minute taker from this week.


#### Chair performance

Mark: Good

Feedback:
- The performance overall was very good, it was very organized, well paced and followed nicely the agenda.
- I like the opening and the check in a lot, felt like the chair was very prepared and really talked to the members when making the agenda.
- It always keept the time in mind.
- As a tip, you could still try to engage the group more. Some members still feel a little quiet.

#### Attitude & Relation

Mark: Good

Feedback:
- The team took the ownership of the meeting, and organized very productive. I can see a lot of improvement in the dynamic of the meeting.
- Everybody was active and cooperant most of the time. There are still some cases where I felt some people were not that focused on the talk when it doesn't seem targeted to them or still very quiet, maybe try to keep an eye on that.
- You are very receptive to feedback and in general listen to each other opinions, good job. Most of to have a nice relation among the group.
- As a tip, to ensure the meeting is as productive as possible, make sure you always keep in mind the feedback from last weeks so you know where to put more effort and what to keep on doing.
