### Backlog

### Submission

Mark: Pass

Feedback: Your submission meets the requirements from the assignment description.


### Backlog Structure

Mark: Pass

Feedback:
- Your structure is good, including a list of stakeholders, terms of the domain and user stories.
- Most parts are covered in detail and clear, but some structure is missing(you will see that in the detailed feedback per part).


### Epics

Mark: Insufficient

Feedback:
- Your backlog should be organized in epics (check assignment description for more clarity) which represent your main features constituted of user stories.
- The prioritization you have right now is a good start, your user stories seem to  be listed according to priority. Make sure you are taking dependencies into consideration. This means that if in an epic you have 2 user stories A and B dependent on A, A goes before B.
- Make sure you formulate your epics accordingly, when you convert you "Basic" and "Advanced" chunks of user stories.
- Make sure your "minimal app" epic is clearly stated, since right now I can assume all of the basic features represent it.
- Try to help your case using Mockups to complement your design and epics, that is not tackled at all
- The content itself seems good, seems like you have a good understanding of the requirements from the lectures
- Are you sure you need admin requirements? Are those something the user shouldn't do or that is required from lectures?


### User Stories

Mark: Insufficient

Feedback:
- The user stories do not follow the required format, please check that again. (This is the reason you got an insufficient here) 
- Most of them seem to have a clear focus from user perspective and describe only 1 action, which is great. If something doesn't satisfy this, try to break it in more user stories.
- Most of them also do not overlap and seem to be very concise and coherent.


### Acceptance Criteria

Mark: Insufficient

Feedback:
- Since most of your stories are small they could have also very clear effects, but you lack the "goal/effect" part of the user story format.
- Make sure you formulate them in a measurable way to be able to see when something is completed.
